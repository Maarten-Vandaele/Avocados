# Avocados

## Workflow and cooperation
1. Going over more theory while peeking at the datasets on tuesday.
2. Settling on the avocado data and going over it together while on the discord chat.
3. Maarten made a repo and shared with Maja. Maja branching off of master.		
4. Toying around with the data and both coming up with some unusable first plots.
5. First usable plot made by Maja while Maarten following along.
6. Distribution of plots among each other.
7. Working on plots separate, while helping with solutions on discord.
8. Combining work and streamlining files on github.

### Maarten's comments
In my opinion a good exercise. I was glad Maja was there to shoot questions at. 
It was 33 procent teamwork 33 procent individual work and 33 procent problem solving each others work. 
Which for me is the perfect ratio.
Which leaves only 1 percent unaccounted for. ;)
