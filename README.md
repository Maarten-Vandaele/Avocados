# Avocados

## Workflow and cooperation
1. Going over more theory while peeking at the datasets on tuesday.
2. Settling on the avocado data and going over it together while on the discord chat.
3. Maarten made a repo and shared with Maja. Maja branching off of master.		
4. Toying around with the data and both coming up with some unusable first plots.
5. First usable plot made by Maja while Maarten following along.
6. Distribution of plots among each other.
7. Working on plots separate, while helping with solutions on discord.
8. Combining work and streamlining files on github.

### Maarten's comments
In my opinion a good exercise. I was glad Maja was there to shoot questions at. 
It was 33 procent teamwork 33 procent individual work and 33 procent problem solving each others work. 
Which for me is the perfect ratio.
Which leaves only 1 percent unaccounted for. ;)


### Maja's comments

Good excercise, much learned. At some point I felt like I was left to Google for help, but later on we were successfully co-working on each others code issues. We combined our ideas, explored them in chat. There was space to communicate about workflow and applications. Even now we're still exchanging on how we can make the code and the graphs work better. On the whole it was an interesting and enjoyable collaboration.

## Results

Our results are visible in the single output notebook. We made in total four line plots, a bar chart and a pie chart, choosing data and visualization methods that may reveal something meaningful about the chosen dataset.
